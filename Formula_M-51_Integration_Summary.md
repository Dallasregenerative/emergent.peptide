- **60% strength gains** when combined with exercise-like pathways
- **True additive benefits** demonstrated in research

### **Expected Outcomes:**
- **2-6 hours:** Metabolic shift to fat burning, stable energy, mental clarity, enhanced exercise performance
- **1-3 days:** Enhanced exercise performance, reduced fatigue, initial metabolic adaptation
- **1-2 weeks:** Energy stability, reduced carb cravings, early strength improvements, better sleep
- **2-4 weeks:** 20% strength improvements, improved body composition changes
- **1-3 months:** Optimized metabolic health with sustained benefits

### **Dosing & Administration:**
- **Standard Dose:** One serving daily (50mg 5-AMINO-1MQ + 1mg SLU-PP-332)
- **Timing:** Morning administration, 2-3 hours before exercise for maximum synergy
- **Route:** Oral administration
- **Duration:** Continuous use or 8-12 week cycles with 2-4 week breaks
