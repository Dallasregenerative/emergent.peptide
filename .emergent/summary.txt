The previous AI engineer meticulously addressed a series of critical bugs preventing PeptideProtocols.ai from reaching a production-ready state, primarily revolving around the Generate Personalized Protocol functionality and persistent blank screen issues. The work began by identifying a hardcoded frontend placeholder text that masked actual backend responses. This led to a cascading series of debugging efforts, uncovering issues like frontend service misconfigurations ( package), inconsistent UI rendering (black and white display, cursor input problems) caused by conflicting build artifacts, and critical service worker caching issues. Concurrently, the engineer enhanced the backend AI protocol generation to include comprehensive clinical details and uniform sections, only to discover a persistent hardcoded fast protocol fallback and an erroneous call to a non-existent parsing method () that prevented the detailed output from being delivered. Despite the engineer's claims of resolution, the user consistently reported lingering display and detail issues, indicating a persistent disconnect between the internal state and the user's observed experience, particularly regarding the comprehensive protocol details and input field behavior. The trajectory concludes with the user still experiencing a blank screen, and the engineer realizing a crucial backend URL mismatch in the frontend's environment configuration is not being picked up by the build process, preventing proper connection. The AI engineer frequently utilized  and  to diagnose and fix infrastructure-related issues.

<product_requirements>
PeptideProtocols.ai is a HIPAA-compliant medical intelligence platform for functional medicine. The application provides an AI assessment wizard, AI protocol generation, a searchable library, and a practitioner portal with PDF export capabilities. Key features include an AI chatbot (Dr. Peptide AI), an enhanced clinical peptide database, predictive analysis, and evidence-based protocols. The platform aims for hospital-grade clinical detail, requiring uniform sections for peptides (Mechanism, Dosing, Stacking, Contraindications, Monitoring, Hyperlinked evidence, Last Updated, outcome stats, voting). A living protocol learning loop is central. Recent additions include dual patient/practitioner sign-in, practitioner application/approval, Stripe subscriptions, patient unlock codes, and practitioner patient management. The platform emphasizes mobile responsiveness, accessibility, and SEO. RegenPro.ai, a complementary GPT-5 integrated platform, offers regenerative medicine protocols across five schools of thought, covering high-value treatments.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a persistent and critical blank screen issue affecting the application's preview URL. This issue continued to manifest despite multiple previous attempts to resolve it, including ensuring frontend service was running, building the application, and clearing service worker caches.

The most recent breakthrough in diagnosis, aided by the , identified the root cause as a crucial mismatch in the  configured in the frontend's  file (). The URL was incorrectly pointing to  instead of the actual preview URL .

The AI engineer successfully edited the  file to correct this URL (Chat Message 164). Following this, the frontend was rebuilt using yarn run v1.22.22
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/run for documentation about this command. (Chat Message 166), and the frontend service was restarted (Chat Message 168). However, subsequent verification steps revealed that the  process was not effectively picking up the updated environment variable. The compiled JavaScript files still contained the old, incorrect backend URL, preventing the frontend from successfully connecting to the backend API and thus resulting in the continuous blank screen.

In parallel, the engineer successfully addressed two specific regressions reported by the user:
1.  **Terminology Update**: The text Bulletproof Protocol Generator was replaced with Intelligent Protocol Generator in , along with related descriptive updates and badge changes.
2.  **Cursor Input Bug**: The problematic cursor jumping experienced in patient information input fields was resolved by implementing a  optimization for the  function in .
3.  **Health Goals Display**: A fix was applied to  to correctly display Health Goals and Primary Concerns by ensuring proper array checking.

All backend services are confirmed to be running and functional, and the AI model used for protocol generation is confirmed as GPT-4. The primary remaining hurdle is ensuring the frontend build correctly incorporates the updated backend URL from the  file to resolve the blank screen on the preview URL.
