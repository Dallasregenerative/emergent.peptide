The previous AI engineer focused on developing the RegenMed AI Pro platform from an MVP state to a more robust application. Initially, the core Critical Priority features—Living Evidence Engine, Advanced Differential Diagnosis System, and Enhanced Explainable AI—were implemented and extensively debugged, primarily addressing method misplacements,  serialization, and data format mismatches in the backend.

Subsequently, the emphasis shifted to establishing a seamless end-to-end practitioner workflow in the frontend. This involved persistent attempts to enable patient selection in the Records tab to trigger the AI analysis and protocol generation in other tabs. Multiple iterations were tried, including direct  handlers on patient cards, simplifying their structure, and finally implementing a reliable dropdown selector, which proved successful in triggering the backend AI functions.

Despite perceived successes by the AI engineer, the user consistently highlighted that while the *workflow* scaffolding and backend *calls* were in place, the core AI engine was still not producing visible clinical outputs (differential diagnoses, evidence-linked protocols, explainable AI visualizations). The engineer acknowledged this gap, committing to fix the core AI engine.

The current conversation culminates in the AI engineer attempting to validate the end-to-end workflow after a backend fix for  handling, only to be interrupted by a GitHub push error due to exposed API keys. The immediate focus then shifted to resolving this security and Git-related issue.

<product_requirements>
The RegenMed AI Pro platform aims to be the world's leading AI-powered system for regenerative medicine, providing personalized, evidence-based treatment protocols and predicting patient outcomes. It's strictly for clinical decision support, not practice management. Key functionalities include multi-modal data ingestion (EHR, DICOM, labs, genomics), AI-powered diagnostic suggestions, personalized protocol generation (including schools of thought and AI-Optimized Best Protocol), and Explainable AI (SHAP/LIME). The system is designed as a Learning Health System with real-time literature integration, global legal status flagging for treatments, advanced imaging/multi-omic analytics, and a practitioner-facing UI optimized for cash-pay practices. The recent focus has been on integrating AI-linked, living protocol-to-evidence mapping and advanced differential diagnosis with explainability, ensuring a holistic AI patient recommendation system.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on making the core AI engine fully functional and completing the end-to-end patient journey within the frontend UI. This involved fixing the patient selection workflow so that selecting a patient in the Records tab would correctly trigger and display AI analysis and protocol generation in their respective tabs.

Initial attempts to fix the  event on patient cards in the  tab (in ) were unsuccessful, leading to various debugging efforts including simplifying click targets and adding console logs/alerts. Despite these efforts, the direct card clicks did not reliably trigger the  function.

To ensure the core AI workflow could be tested and demonstrated, the engineer implemented a Quick Select Patient dropdown in the  tab. This dropdown was successfully validated to trigger the  function, correctly update the  state, navigate to the  tab, and initiate the backend AI analysis process. Backend fixes in  were also made to ensure the AI analysis endpoints ( and ) properly fetched  using  passed from the frontend.

At the very last stage of validating this end-to-end workflow, the AI engineer attempted to push the code to GitHub but encountered a  error, indicating secret keys were present. The immediate task then shifted to resolving this security vulnerability by removing the  from , adding  files to , and cleaning up git history. The engineer is currently in the process of providing a backup solution or a quick fix for the GitHub push issue, as the user indicated they are still facing problems.
