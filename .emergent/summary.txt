The previous AI engineer successfully brought the PeptideProtocols.ai application from a non-functional state to a significantly enhanced version, addressing multiple critical bugs and feature requests. Initially, the focus was on resolving a persistent blank screen issue. This involved debugging frontend build processes, service worker caching, and ultimately, correcting a misconfigured  in the frontend's  file and ensuring the  package was installed and the build directory correctly generated.

Following the blank screen resolution, the user reported that protocol generation was generic, not personalized. This led to a series of fixes:
1.  **GPT-5 Integration:** The AI model was upgraded from GPT-4 to GPT-5 across  and .
2.  **Personalization Logic:** A hardcoded fallback protocol in  was removed and replaced with actual AI-based generation, including a new  method.
3.  **Case Sensitivity:** A critical bug where AI-generated peptide names (e.g., SEMAGLUTIDE) didn't match the dosing calculator's expected case (Semaglutide) was fixed by normalizing peptide names in .
4.  **Comprehensive Protocol Population:** The final protocol output was showing N/A for many sections due to a key-naming mismatch between the AI's output () and the  function's expectations (). This was resolved by updating the mapping in .

The trajectory culminated in a comprehensive version analysis, where the AI engineer identified both merged strengths (GPT-5, personalization, populated sections) and still-missing features (e.g., Progress Tracking, Email Integration, Cost Analysis) that were never fully implemented across any version. The immediate next task identified is to complete the Progress Tracking Service.

PeptideProtocols.ai is a HIPAA-compliant medical intelligence platform for functional medicine, offering an AI assessment wizard, AI protocol generation, a searchable library, and a practitioner portal with PDF export. The core problem it solves is providing hospital-grade clinical details through evidence-based, personalized protocols, emphasizing uniform sections (Mechanism, Dosing, Stacking, Contraindications, Monitoring, Hyperlinked evidence, Last Updated, outcome stats, voting). A living protocol learning loop is central to its design. The platform includes dual patient/practitioner sign-in, practitioner approval, Stripe subscriptions, patient unlock codes, and practitioner patient management. It's designed for mobile responsiveness, accessibility, and SEO. The application has evolved through several versions, aiming for GPT-5 integration and continuous enhancement of personalized, detailed clinical recommendations, while struggling with regressions in functionality and data population across updates.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had just completed a Comprehensive Version Merge (Version 4). This involved addressing several critical issues: resolving the persistent blank screen (by fixing frontend URL configuration,  package installation, and build process), upgrading the AI model to GPT-5, and most importantly, fixing the generic protocol generation. The personalization fix involved removing hardcoded fallbacks, resolving a case sensitivity bug between AI output and the  (e.g., SEMAGLUTIDE vs Semaglutide), and correcting data mapping mismatches in  to ensure all comprehensive protocol sections were properly populated instead of showing N/A.

The system is currently producing truly personalized, evidence-based protocols with full clinical detail. However, following this successful merge, the user requested a deeper analysis of all past versions to identify any still-missing features. This led to a detailed breakdown identifying several planned features (like Progress Tracking, Email Integration, Cost Analysis) that were never fully implemented across any version. The AI engineer is now at the point of initiating the implementation of these identified missing components, starting with the Progress Tracking Service.
