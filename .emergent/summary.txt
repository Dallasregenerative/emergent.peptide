The previous AI engineer meticulously addressed a series of critical bugs preventing PeptideProtocols.ai from reaching a production-ready state, primarily revolving around the Generate Personalized Protocol functionality. The work began by identifying a hardcoded frontend placeholder text that masked actual backend responses. This led to a cascading series of debugging efforts, uncovering issues like frontend service misconfigurations ( package), inconsistent UI rendering (black and white display, cursor input problems) caused by conflicting build artifacts, and critical service worker caching issues. Concurrently, the engineer enhanced the backend AI protocol generation to include comprehensive clinical details and uniform sections, only to discover a persistent hardcoded fast protocol fallback and an erroneous call to a non-existent parsing method () that prevented the detailed output from being delivered. Despite the engineer's claims of resolution, the user consistently reported lingering display and detail issues, indicating a persistent disconnect between the internal state and the user's observed experience, particularly regarding the comprehensive protocol details and input field behavior. The trajectory concludes with the user still dissatisfied with protocol detail, and the engineer re-evaluating the requirements.

<product_requirements>
PeptideProtocols.ai is a HIPAA-compliant medical intelligence platform for functional medicine. The application provides an AI assessment wizard, AI protocol generation, a searchable library, and a practitioner portal with PDF export capabilities. Key features include an AI chatbot (Dr. Peptide AI), an enhanced clinical peptide database, predictive analysis, and evidence-based protocols. The platform aims for hospital-grade clinical detail, requiring uniform sections for peptides (Mechanism, Dosing, Stacking, Contraindications, Monitoring, Hyperlinked evidence, Last Updated, outcome stats, voting). A living protocol learning loop is central. Recent additions include dual patient/practitioner sign-in, practitioner application/approval, Stripe subscriptions, patient unlock codes, and practitioner patient management. The platform emphasizes mobile responsiveness, accessibility, and SEO. RegenPro.ai, a complementary GPT-5 integrated platform, offers regenerative medicine protocols across five schools of thought, covering high-value treatments.

<code_architecture>

-   ****: Main FastAPI application handling API routes and core logic.
    -   **Importance**: Central API router for authentication, assessment, and protocol generation. Defines the  schema and  for building protocol responses.
    -   **Changes**: Fixed JSON serialization with . Ensured  sections correctly mapped to top-level .  was modified to accept and structure the new uniform sections like , , etc.
-   ****: Contains core AI chatbot logic and protocol generation.
    -   **Importance**: Houses the  function, interacting with the LLM via . Defines the AI prompt and handles AI response processing.
    -   **Changes**: Initially faced issues with  API usage. Crucially, a hardcoded fast protocol fallback (lines 325-398) was present and later removed (Message 259) to ensure AI-generated comprehensive protocols. The prompt within the  (lines 980-1080) was enhanced to explicitly request detailed uniform sections. An erroneous call to a non-existent  method was removed (Message 283).
-   ****: Primary React UI entry point, handling assessment flow and protocol display.
    -   **Importance**: Manages state for the assessment wizard, orchestrates API calls to the backend, and renders the generated protocol.
    -   **Changes**: Hardcoded Protocol Summary text (lines 2670-2671) was the initial fix target. Assessment form inputs were refactored to controlled components with . Cursor input issues were addressed by debouncing  (lines 147-170) using  and removing problematic  props (Message 222) which caused React re-rendering. The protocol display logic was extensively updated (Message 234) to render all newly introduced uniform sections with their corresponding data and icons. Missing Lucide React icon imports were added (Message 240).
-   ****: Service Worker file for Progressive Web App (PWA) caching.
    -   **Importance**: Caches static assets for offline access and performance.
    -   **Changes**: Updated cache version (from  to ) and corrected cached resource URLs to match actual hashed build file names (Message 115) to resolve blank screen issues caused by stale caches.
-   ****: Main CSS file.
    -   **Importance**: Where Tailwind CSS directives are imported and compiled into final styles.
    -   **Changes**: During debugging a black and white UI issue, it was found that Tailwind directives were not being processed correctly. The file was temporarily replaced with a manually compiled version of Tailwind CSS classes (Message 151) to force correct styling.
-   ****: Supervisor configuration.
    -   **Importance**: Manages frontend and backend processes, ensuring they run continuously.
    -   **Changes**: Frontend command repeatedly faced issues with  not found, requiring reinstallation of  (Message 52) to ensure the frontend process could start.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a persistent issue where the user claimed the generated protocol still lacked detail and that cursor input issues persisted, despite the engineer's previous confirmations of resolution. The engineer had extensively worked on fixing the Generate Personalized Protocol functionality. This included:

1.  **Hardcoded Frontend Text:** Initially, a hardcoded Protocol Summary placeholder in  was masking the actual protocol output. This was identified and modified to display dynamic content.
2.  **Frontend Styling & Input Issues:** The user reported black and white display and cursor issues (requiring cursor repositioning after each letter). This was traced to a build/deployment conflict and later to a PostCSS/Tailwind CSS compilation issue in the frontend. The  process was re-executed, and a manual compilation of Tailwind CSS was performed and applied to  to restore styling. The cursor issue was resolved by debouncing the  function and removing problematic  props from React components in  to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
3.  **Blank Screen Bug:** The user reported a completely blank screen on the preview URL. This was diagnosed by the  as a service worker caching issue where  was caching old, non-existent file names. The service worker's cache version and resource URLs were updated.
4.  **Backend Protocol Detail:** The AI engineer extensively enhanced the AI prompt in  and the protocol structure in  to generate hospital-grade protocols with specific uniform sections (Mechanism, Dosing, Stacking, Contraindications, Monitoring, Hyperlinked evidence, Last Updated, Outcome stats, Voting). However, it was discovered that a hardcoded fast protocol fallback was still present in  (which was removed) and that a non-existent method  was being called, preventing the comprehensive AI output from being correctly utilized. These backend issues were addressed.

Despite these fixes, the user's latest feedback (Message 291) indicates that the protocol *still lacks detail* and asks to look for the list we had that is everything from contraindications to rational. The AI engineer is currently searching for this comprehensive specification.
