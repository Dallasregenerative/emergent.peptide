Patient: David Chen
DOB: August 22, 1996
Patient ID: DC-2025-002
Test Date: January 8, 2025
Report Date: January 10, 2025

Referring Physician: Dr. Mark Thompson, Sports Medicine
Testing Laboratory: AthleticGenome Labs
Sample Type: Blood
Sample ID: AG-2025-DC002

GENETIC MARKERS ANALYZED:

1. COL5A1 (Collagen Type V Alpha 1) - rs12722
   Genotype: C/T (Heterozygous)
   Clinical Significance: INCREASED INJURY RISK
   Impact: Associated with increased risk of tendon and ligament injuries
   Athletic Relevance: 2.2x increased risk of Achilles tendon injuries

2. COL1A1 (Collagen Type I Alpha 1) - rs1800012
   Genotype: G/T (Heterozygous)
   Clinical Significance: MODERATE INJURY RISK
   Impact: Reduced collagen stability, slower healing
   Frequency: 15% of elite athletes carry this variant

3. TNC (Tenascin-C) - rs2104772
   Genotype: A/A (Homozygous variant)
   Clinical Significance: INCREASED INJURY RISK
   Impact: Associated with rotator cuff tendinopathy susceptibility
   Clinical Note: Particularly relevant for overhead athletes

4. MMP3 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 3) - rs3025058
   Genotype: 5A/6A (Heterozygous)
   Clinical Significance: VARIABLE HEALING
   Impact: 5A allele associated with increased MMP3 activity and tissue breakdown
   
5. IL6 (Interleukin 6) - rs1800795
   Genotype: G/C (Heterozygous)
   Clinical Significance: ENHANCED INFLAMMATION
   Impact: Increased inflammatory response to tissue injury
   Recovery Implication: May require longer recovery periods

6. ACTN3 (Alpha-Actinin-3) - rs1815739
   Genotype: C/C (Wild type)
   Clinical Significance: POWER ATHLETE ADVANTAGE
   Impact: Preserved alpha-actinin-3 ("sprint gene")
   Athletic Performance: Beneficial for power/sprint activities

OVERALL GENETIC PROFILE:
INJURY-PRONE PHENOTYPE with Enhanced Power Capability

INTERPRETATION:
David Chen carries multiple genetic variants that predispose to tendon and soft tissue injuries, particularly relevant for overhead sports activities. The combination of COL5A1, COL1A1, and TNC variants significantly increases susceptibility to rotator cuff injuries. However, he maintains the advantageous ACTN3 genotype for explosive athletic performance.

SPORTS MEDICINE RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Injury Prevention Protocol:
   - Enhanced warm-up routines (minimum 20 minutes)
   - Progressive loading programs for tendons
   - Eccentric strengthening exercises
   - Regular soft tissue maintenance (massage, stretching)

2. Training Modifications:
   - Reduce overhead volume during symptomatic periods
   - Implement periodized training with adequate recovery
   - Focus on posterior chain strengthening
   - Monitor training load carefully

3. Nutritional Support:
   - Vitamin C supplementation for collagen synthesis
   - Omega-3 fatty acids for anti-inflammatory effects
   - Consider collagen peptide supplementation
   
4. Medical Management:
   - Regular musculoskeletal screening
   - Early intervention for minor injuries
   - Consider prophylactic interventions during high-stress periods

5. Career Counseling:
   - Discuss long-term implications for competitive swimming
   - Consider technique modifications to reduce shoulder stress
   - Plan for injury prevention throughout career

GENETIC COUNSELOR NOTES:
Recommend sharing results with coaching staff and sports medicine team. Family history of athletic injuries should be obtained. Consider genetic testing for siblings involved in competitive sports.
