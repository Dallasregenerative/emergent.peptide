COMPLETE METABOLIC PANEL:
- Glucose: 88 mg/dL (Normal)
- BUN: 18 mg/dL (Normal)
- Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL (Normal)
- Electrolytes: Within normal limits

INTERPRETATION:
Elevated muscle enzymes (CK, LDH) consistent with muscle stress/microtrauma likely related to intensive training. No systemic inflammation detected. Nutritional parameters adequate for athletic performance.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Modify training intensity temporarily
- Consider sports medicine consultation
- Repeat muscle enzymes in 2-3 weeks
- Ensure adequate rest and recovery
