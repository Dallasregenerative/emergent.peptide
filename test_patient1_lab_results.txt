INFLAMMATORY MARKERS PANEL

ESR (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate):
Result: 32 mm/hr [H]
Reference Range: 0-20 mm/hr (Female)
Status: ELEVATED

CRP (C-Reactive Protein):
Result: 8.5 mg/L [H]
Reference Range: <3.0 mg/L
Status: ELEVATED

Rheumatoid Factor:
Result: 12 IU/mL
Reference Range: <14 IU/mL
Status: NEGATIVE

Anti-CCP Antibody:
Result: 8 units
Reference Range: <17 units
Status: NEGATIVE

ADDITIONAL TESTS:

Complete Blood Count:
- WBC: 7.2 x10³/µL (Normal: 4.5-11.0)
- Hemoglobin: 13.1 g/dL (Normal: 12.0-16.0)
- Platelets: 285 x10³/µL (Normal: 150-450)

Basic Metabolic Panel:
- Glucose: 98 mg/dL (Normal: 70-100)
- Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL (Normal: 0.6-1.1)
- BUN: 16 mg/dL (Normal: 7-20)

Vitamin D, 25-Hydroxy:
Result: 22 ng/mL [L]
Reference Range: 30-100 ng/mL
Status: INSUFFICIENT

INTERPRETATION:
Elevated inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP) consistent with inflammatory arthritis or osteoarthritis with secondary inflammation. Negative rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP suggest non-rheumatoid etiology. Vitamin D insufficiency noted.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Clinical correlation with imaging studies
- Consider vitamin D supplementation
- Monitor inflammatory markers
- Rheumatology consultation if symptoms persist
