GENETIC TEST RESULTS - OSTEOARTHRITIS RISK PANEL

Patient: Maria Rodriguez
DOB: March 15, 1979
Patient ID: MR-2025-001
Test Date: January 5, 2025
Report Date: January 7, 2025

Referring Physician: Dr. Sarah Johnson, Orthopedic Surgery
Testing Laboratory: GenomeHealth Labs
Sample Type: Saliva
Sample ID: GH-2025-MR001

GENETIC MARKERS ANALYZED:

1. COL2A1 (Collagen Type II Alpha 1 Chain) - rs1061237
   Genotype: C/T (Heterozygous)
   Clinical Significance: MODERATE RISK
   Impact: Associated with increased susceptibility to cartilage degeneration
   Frequency: 35% of population carries this variant

2. COMP (Cartilage Oligomeric Matrix Protein) - rs28933982
   Genotype: G/G (Wild type)
   Clinical Significance: NO INCREASED RISK
   Impact: Normal cartilage matrix protein function expected
   
3. VDR (Vitamin D Receptor) - rs2228570
   Genotype: A/A (Homozygous variant)
   Clinical Significance: MODERATE RISK
   Impact: Reduced vitamin D receptor activity, affecting bone density
   Frequency: 42% of population carries this genotype

4. GDF5 (Growth Differentiation Factor 5) - rs143383
   Genotype: C/T (Heterozygous) 
   Clinical Significance: INCREASED RISK
   Impact: Associated with reduced joint space width and early OA onset
   
5. ASPN (Asporin) - D14 repeat
   Genotype: D13/D14 (Heterozygous)
   Clinical Significance: MODERATE RISK
   Impact: D14 allele associated with increased OA susceptibility in Asian populations

OVERALL GENETIC RISK ASSESSMENT:
MODERATE-HIGH RISK (3.2x increased risk compared to population average)

INTERPRETATION:
Maria Rodriguez carries genetic variants that predispose to osteoarthritis development. The combination of COL2A1, VDR, and GDF5 variants suggests increased susceptibility to cartilage degeneration and reduced bone density. The ASPN D14 variant provides additional risk, particularly given family ancestry.

CLINICAL RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Lifestyle modifications: Weight management, low-impact exercise
2. Vitamin D supplementation (given VDR variant and lab deficiency)
3. Joint protection strategies
4. Regular monitoring for early OA symptoms
5. Consider prophylactic interventions (glucosamine, chondroitin)
6. Family counseling regarding hereditary risk

GENETIC COUNSELOR NOTES:
Recommend genetic counseling for family planning and risk assessment of offspring. First-degree relatives may benefit from genetic testing.
